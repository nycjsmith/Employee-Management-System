The prototype developed for this system shall facilitate the process of scheduling the right employee for the right job at the right time to ensure proper flow of control and smooth administration.

This project follows Agile scrum process model or methodology for the development of the project. This scrum model uses a product backlog, a prioritized list of high-level requirements written as User Stories. At the start of a sprint, many user stories are selected and put into the Sprint Backlog. These stories are the features that will be implemented during the sprint. For each user story different phases are traversed: requirements, Use case analysis, System Model, Data Model, User Interface Design implementation and testing. Each sprint a duration. After the sprints, the product must be delivered to the customer.
